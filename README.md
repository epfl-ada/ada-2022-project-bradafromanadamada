# Interest shift in ecology during the pandemic

## Abstract
Ecology, a very simple term, but everyone has heard of it and has their opinion on the subject. We know that humanity will need to face more and more crisis (such as energetic crisis, political crisis, etc...) in the upcoming times. One can wonder how a big crisis such as the pandemic has affected the interest of ecology, during the crisis and also after. Through the view counts of Wikipedia articles and google search around the pandemic to represent the interest on the topic, we will try to determine if there is a some correlation with the state of the country at that specific time (through the number of COVID death at that time for example). 

## Research questions

## Additional dataset
*  [**View counts of wikipedia articles**](data/added_data/massviews-20180101-20220101.csv) in the category [Climate_change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Climate_change), data taken using [massviews](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/massviews/) across the period of time 01-01-2018 to 01-01-2022. It is also possible to look for the view count of the Wikipedia articles in different languages, allowing the possibility to compare between them. <br>
* [**Covid data**](data/added_data/owid-covid-data.csv.gz). Data on the number of COVID cases and COVID death per country and across time, data taken from [Our World in data (WHO)](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) <br>
* [**Google trend**](data/added_data/EcologyWorldTrend.csv). Google trend data on the term `Ecology` ([Google trend](https://trends.google.fr/trends/) is a tool from Google to analyze the number of google search on a specific topic) <br>
* [**Air quality**](data\added_data\airquality_data_2020_concat.csv.gz). Quality of the air during the COVID period, data per country/region (taken from the [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-and-covid19)) <br>
These datasets allow us to have a more precise information on the interest for the climate change and to compare the results with the state of the word (in terms of the air quality and the COVID pandemic) at that time.
